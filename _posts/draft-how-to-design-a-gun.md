How do you design a gun for your game? A lot of first-time designers might take bits they like and mash them together. There's a lot of art kits and even some programs that allow you to do this. Unfortunately the result often doesn't make sense, and looks inconsistent.

A lot of designers try to make something that looks the part - big chunky parts that look powerful, or shiny streaks that look cool - but there's so many ways to do that. Instead I think form should follow function. Understand how a gun should work, how it's held and operated, and you can design a gun that makes sense and fits the setting.

Let's try with a futuristic version of the humble firearm. Even today's modern assault rifles are mechanically very simple, and are fundamentally very similar to the earliest firearms - muskets, hand cannons etc.

It may not seem so at first; a modern firearm looks sleek, has many bits, and it's not clear how they work just by looking at it from the outside. But break the parts down and you can see the basic parts there:

- A barrel - this is where the bullet goes, an explosion pushes it out the other end
- Something that sets off that explosion - in modern firearms it's a pin that strikes a primer
- A grip and trigger
- A way to load new bullets - usually a magazine

That's it really, at least the basics. A common feature in semi-automatic and automatic firearms is a mechanism that uses part of the explosive power to load the next cartridge and ready the firing pin. For example, gas-operated firearms funnel some of the high-pressure gas from the barrel back towards the chamber, stripping the spent case, loading the next one and cocking the hammer, ready to strike and fire the next round.
