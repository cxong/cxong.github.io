I'm a sucker for level design and design patterns, so when I came across this [article](https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/AhmedKhalifa/20190610/344344/Level_Design_Patterns_in_2D_Games.php) (and [paper](http://akhalifa.com/documents/level-design-patterns.pdf)) called ["Level Design Patterns in 2D games"](https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/AhmedKhalifa/20190610/344344/Level_Design_Patterns_in_2D_Games.php), I had to read it! Unfortunately it's a bit wordy, so I thought I'd summarise it and throw in a bunch of pictures! Enjoy!

# Guidance

Guide the player through the path they need to take.

1. Level shape
    | Super Mario Bros. | Super Meat Boy |
    | ------------- | ------------- |

2. Collectibles (a.k.a. *breadcrumbing*)
    | Donkey Kong Country 2 | Granny Smith |
    | ------------- | ------------- |

# Safe Zone

Give the players a place safe from hazards so they can stop and think.

# Foreshadowing

Partially introduce something new to the player, only to fully reveal it later. This can serve to teach the player, or encourage exploration.

1. New hazard that's out of reach
2. New enemy that foreshadows a boss
3. New objects that cannot be used until later, to encourage exploration.

# Layering

Combining multiple objects to create new experiences, like a harder challenge.

1. Multiples of the same object
2. Different objects

# Branching

Giving the player different choices.

1. Branching with no restrictions - gives the feeling of exploration
2. Conditional branching - stimulates curiosity and may require backtracking
3. Risk-reward branches - encourages players to invest more time in the game by rewarding skill

# Pace Breaking

Dramatically changing the pacing of the game - higher or lower tension.

1. Introduce difficulty (e.g. bosses) to increase tension
2. Decrease tension to let players enjoy other parts of the game, or learn a new mechanic
3. Decrease tension to set up for a more dramatic increase later (e.g. just before a boss fight)
4. Controlling tension through level design
