How do you design a gun for your game? A lot of first-time designers might take bits they like and mash them together. There's a lot of art kits and even some programs that allow you to do this. Unfortunately the result often doesn't make sense, and looks inconsistent.

Some designers try to make something that looks the part - guns with powerful-looking big chunky shapes, or cool-looking shiny streaks - but there's often little sense going into these designs.

Instead I think form should follow function. Understand how a gun should work, how it's held and operated, and you can design a gun that makes sense and fits the setting.

Let's try with a futuristic version of the humble firearm. Even today's modern assault rifles are mechanically very simple, and are fundamentally very similar to the earliest firearms, like muskets and hand cannons.

It may not seem so at first; a modern firearm looks sleek, has many moving parts, and it's not clear how they work just by looking at it. But break it down and you can see the basic components:

- A barrel - this is where the bullet goes, an explosion pushes it out the other end
- Something that sets off that explosion - in modern firearms it's a pin that strikes a primer
- A grip and trigger
- A way to load new bullets - usually a magazine

That's it really, at least the basics. A common feature in semi-automatic and automatic firearms is a mechanism that uses some of the explosive power to load the next cartridge and ready the firing pin. For example, gas-operated firearms funnel some of the high-pressure gas from the barrel back towards the chamber, stripping the spent case, loading the next one and cocking the hammer, ready to strike and fire the next round.

So even the most modern firearms are simple machines. You might wonder why they're not more complex, or more high tech. And they could be; we could, today, include features like [electronic firing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_firing), [caseless ammunition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caseless_ammunition), and digital ammo counters, but they are seldom used in real guns, only in toys and prototypes.

The reason is twofold: cost and reliability. Guns are serious tools, used in extreme circumstances, and so reliability is a top concern. Having a gun fail in combat makes a life-and-death difference. Guns are also used in large quantities - there could be millions of them in a large army - so their cost needs to be reasonable.

What this means is that even in the near future, firearms will resemble those of today, maybe with some whizzbang extras.
