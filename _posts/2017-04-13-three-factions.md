Some of the most fun and interesting games feature **three factions**. The factions are unique, provide lots of gameplay variety, and are flavourful too. But how do you **mechanically balance** three radically different factions? And how do you come up with three **thematically unique** factions?

It's not easy. With just two factions, balance is a lot easier, as you simply buff one and nerf the other, but with three (or more) factions, anything you do could inadvertently affect the balance with the third faction.

One common method is to take a classic **duality**, and have two factions represent each extreme, with the third, "balanced" faction in the middle. [TVTrope's article](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FactionCalculus) on the subject mentions the classic duality of *powerhouse/subversive*. So one faction is a powerhouse, the second is subversive, and the third balanced between the two.

How does this work? The important thing is that there is no inherent advantage of either side of this duality. The powerhouse is powerful but slow and predictable; the subversive is weak but fast and flexible.

A great example of this is in Westwood's Dune RTS games and the unique tanks of each faction. The "evil", powerhouse Harkonnen have the devastator, the most powerful in the game but slow and ponderous. The "insidious", subversive Ordos have the deviator, a tank which has no attack but can temporarily take over enemy tanks. The "noble", balanced Atreides have the sonic tank, which apart from having a unique attack, is otherwise equivalent to a heavy tank.

Another example of this (and of three factions in general) is, of course, Starcraft. The Protoss tend to have strong yet slow units, the Zerg have weaker, faster units and can expand faster, and the Terran are somewhere in between.

- One theme: normal/human faction, plus two variations on a duality theme: magic/tech, bio/tech
  - Starcraft: Terran (normal), Zerg (bio), Protoss (tech)
  - Classic RPG: Human (normal), Orc (physical), Elf (magic)
  - To make things interesting, the normal/balanced faction can be mechanically complex, e.g. special abilities
  - Thematically, the normal/balanced faction has some desirable quality, like honour, adaptability, "the good guys"
- Radical third: third faction is unique
  - Dune: Guild/Emperor/Landsraad, Guild wields soft power but doesn't want hard power
  - CnC3: Scrin are aliens
- Mechanical uniqueness: three aspects, each faction is good at one, bad at one, mediocre at one, so any non-mirror matchup is asymmetrical yet balanced
- Another aspect to consider: different objectives. Results in unbalanced yet interesting gameplay and narratives

- Case studies:
  - Starcraft
  - Golden Axe (a negative example; the man is least popular)
  - Dune/CnC Generals/CnC3
  - RA3 quite complex, with different balance on land/sea/air
