I'm a big believer in learning from others' examples, especially for games: to make better games, you can look for similar games to your own (and not just the same genre!), and see what worked and what didn't. The game I'm making is [C-Dogs SDL](cxong.github.io/cdogs-sdl/), an **overhead 8-directional shoot-em-up**. A while ago I [started looking for similar games](https://github.com/cxong/cdogs-sdl/issues/80), looking for cool features I can steal, but also looking for places where they weren't fun, and *why*. [**Bertram25**](https://github.com/Bertram25) (of [*Valyria Tear*](valyriatear.blogspot.com) and [*OpenDungeons*](http://opendungeons.github.io/)) encouraged me to elaborate on some of my conclusions in a blog post, so here it is :smile:!

## What are Overhead 8-Directional Shoot-em-ups?

What a mouthful! It's a genre (or sub-genre) that doesn't get mentioned a lot. In a nutshell, it is where you can **move and shoot in 8 directions, from an overhead perspective**. Sounds awfully specific, and in practice people simply describe these games as *top-down shooters* or *2D shooters*, which lumps them together with other sub-genres like *twin-stick shooters* ([*Geometry Wars*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry_Wars)), *scrolling shooters* ([*Gradius*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradius), most of the [*Touhou games*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touhou_Project)), *run-and-guns* ([*Contra*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra_(video_game))), even games like [*Asteroids*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)) (whose sub-genre's name I don't know, but would include the [*Strike series*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_series) or even the on-foot sections of [*2D GTA*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_(video_game))). Fans of those sub-genres will understand how different they are; it's somewhat like lumping *Snakes and Ladders* with *Monopoly* together, because both are board games where pieces are moved using dice.

This is because *small differences in game mechanics can mean big changes in gameplay*. I think overhead 8-directional shoot-em-ups strikes a sweet balance between **movement** and **shooting** that creates an even mix of tactical play and arcade action. The 8 directions means some, but not complete, freedom in engaging enemies around you. As a player, you will:

1. **Move** into an ideal firing line
1. **Shoot** in one of the 8 directions

But also:

1. Make **tactical decisions** whether to stay back and shoot in one direction, or charge in and shoot in many directions
1. You can freely move to **dodge** incoming fire, but doing so will **affect your line of fire**

It is this close relation between moving and shooting, and limitations in both, that creates very dynamic gameplay. Great games in this genre understand this, and design the rest of the game to take advantage of this, from *map design*, to *weapons*, to *enemy AI*.
