Music in games is all-too-often relegated to the background, doing little more than filling silence, pasted on as an afterthought. Recently I've been contributing to the open source match-3 puzzle game [_FreeBlocks_](https://github.com/dorkster/freeblocks), and the surprising quality of the music reminded me of the true power of music, that it can not only enhance but elevate the game to new heights.

## Good music

But first let me show an example of music done right: the main theme of [_Enter the Dragon_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enter_the_Dragon). I used to be a muso and early on I realised this: the world is filled with crap music, and most people don't care. A depressing anecdote along these lines is from an acquaintance who played a jazz gig for a large dinner party, who received the following feedback from the client:

> You guys were perfect! We hardly noticed you were playing.

People didn't care about what they played, let alone how they played it. They only cared that there was _something_ to fill the silence. Most people, from games to movies, treated music the same way. All it had to do was fit and stay unobtrusive; who cares if it was "memorable" or "moving", right? Have a desert-themed level? Just find some [vaguely-Arabic music](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShiftingSandLand) and call it a day!

Well _Enter the Dragon_ cared, and I noticed because I cared too. The main theme shows this clearly; the music tells you _exactly what this movie is about_, with not a hint of subtlety, and all in the first minute no less. All you have to do is pay attention. Try for yourself: see if you can figure out what the movie is about, by listening to the music alone:

[Kiais](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiai) and Asian instruments? _Kung fu_. Blending into electric bass? _Possibly set in some East-meets-West locale_. Funky wah-wah guitar? _Blaxploitation_. [Diminished chord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-diminished_seventh_chord)? _Something sinister, possibly involving spies and conspiracies_. Yes, _everything_ in the music tells you something about the movie, and if you were to guess _you'd be right_. It gets better if you watch and listen to the opening sequence, as the music changes right on cue to what's happening on screen - the stars' names, their first appearances, changes in the scene. If you were to guess that this is the work of a master composer, [you'd be right too](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lalo_Schifrin).

To take a gaming example, one of the high water marks for video game music is _Sonic 3_, due in no small part to collaboration with [world-class musicians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_3#Michael_Jackson.27s_involvement). For example, stage 1 of the game, _Angel Island Zone_, takes place in a tropical jungle environment, so the music is suitably cheery and Carribean with steel drums and marimbas. At the end of _Act 1_ however, the jungle is set _on fire_, with the level palette changed to an omnious orange and brown, an excellent signal for the ramp-up in difficulty. What's really clever though is the music: _Act 2_ has a different track, but listen and compare the two tracks:

[![Act 1](http://img.youtube.com/vi/sC-d-AM0gCM/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-d-AM0gCM)
[![Act 2](http://img.youtube.com/vi/_GWv8JaJpc8/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GWv8JaJpc8)

Notice anything? The two are _basically two versions of the same piece_, one in a major key and one in minor! They have essentially the same structure too. The music is saying, "Act 2 is like Act 1 only darker and harder", which is exactly what the graphics are also saying. The same compositional technique is used in stage 2, where the sleeker and faster Act 2 (with its jets and speed wheels) is reflected in its music.

## Match 3 harmony

Moving back to _FreeBlocks_; I was looking for additional music for the game and found [this excellent piece](http://opengameart.org/content/crystal-cave-mysterious-ambience-seamless-loop) by [_pixelsphere
