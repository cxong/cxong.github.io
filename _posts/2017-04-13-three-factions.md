TODO: starcraft, rotk, dune

Some of the most fun and interesting games feature **three factions**. The factions are unique, provide lots of gameplay variety, and are flavourful too. But how do you **mechanically balance** three radically different factions? And how do you come up with three **thematically unique** factions?

It's not easy. With just two factions, balance is a lot easier, as you simply buff one and nerf the other, but with three (or more) factions, anything you do could inadvertently affect the balance with the third faction.

## Duality

One common method is to take a classic **duality**, and have two factions represent each extreme, with the third, "balanced" faction in the middle. [TVTrope's article](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FactionCalculus) on the subject mentions the classic duality of *powerhouse/subversive*. So one faction is a powerhouse, the second is subversive, and the third balanced between the two.

TODO: yin/yang

How does this work? The important thing is that there is no inherent advantage of either side of this duality. The powerhouse is powerful but slow and predictable; the subversive is weak but fast and flexible.

A great example of this is in Westwood's Dune RTS games and the unique tanks of each faction. The "evil", powerhouse Harkonnen have the devastator, the most powerful in the game but slow and ponderous. The "insidious", subversive Ordos have the deviator, a tank which has no attack but can temporarily take over enemy tanks. The "noble", balanced Atreides have the sonic tank, which apart from having a unique attack, is otherwise equivalent to a heavy tank.

Another example of this (and of three factions in general) is, of course, Starcraft. The Protoss tend to have strong yet slow units, the Zerg have weaker, faster units and can expand faster, and the Terran are somewhere in between.

Duality also works thematically. In the classic good/evil dual, the middle ground is **neutral** - sometimes good, sometimes evil, but perhaps just driven by a morally ambiguous motive, like rational self-interest. A great example of this is the [**alignment system** in Dungeons and Dragons](http://easydamus.com/alignment.html), which also has another duality - law/chaos.

There are lots of thematic duals to consider. Magic/spirituality vs. technology/science, biology/nature vs. industry, East vs. West, men vs. women... endless examples if you pay attention.

The problem with the "balanced", "neutral" faction in dualities is that they can seem bland compared to the two extreme factions. To compensate, designers usually give them something unique. The neutral faction often has special abilities, or some other desirable quality.

For example, in [Golden Axe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Axe_(video_game)) the man is clearly supposed to be the "main" character, but because he is worse than the woman at magic and worse than the dwarf at physical attacks, most players avoided playing him in favour of the other two.

TODO: CnC Generals and USA with special abilities / air

On the other hand, in [C&C Generals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_%26_Conquer:_Generals), the balanced faction USA is not as strong as China and not as subversive as GLA, but are compensated mechanically with the most unique units with special abilities, and thematically by being *the good guys*. USA's tanks can be augmented with special drones, and their infantry tends to have better special abilities, making them the most versatile faction.

- One theme: normal/human faction, plus two variations on a duality theme: magic/tech, bio/tech
  - Starcraft: Terran (normal), Zerg (bio), Protoss (tech)
  - Classic RPG: Human (normal), Orc (physical), Elf (magic)
  - To make things interesting, the normal/balanced faction can be mechanically complex, e.g. special abilities
  - Thematically, the normal/balanced faction has some desirable quality, like honour, adaptability, "the good guys"
- Radical third: third faction is unique
  - Dune: Guild/Emperor/Landsraad, Guild wields soft power but doesn't want hard power
  - CnC3: Scrin are aliens
- Mechanical uniqueness: three aspects, each faction is good at one, bad at one, mediocre at one, so any non-mirror matchup is asymmetrical yet balanced
- Another aspect to consider: different objectives. Results in unbalanced yet interesting gameplay and narratives

- Case studies:
  - Starcraft
  - Golden Axe (a negative example; the man is least popular)
  - Dune/CnC Generals/CnC3
  - RA3 quite complex, with different balance on land/sea/air
