- A post about how to come up with three factions in games, both thematically and mechanically
- One theme: normal/human faction, plus two variations on a duality theme: magic/tech, bio/tech
  - Starcraft: Terran (normal), Zerg (bio), Protoss (tech)
  - Classic RPG: Human (normal), Orc (physical), Elf (magic)
- Radical third: third faction is unique
  - Dune: Guild/Emperor/Landsraad, Guild wields soft power but doesn't want hard power
  - CnC3: Scrin are aliens
- Mechanical uniqueness: three aspects, each faction is good at one, bad at one, mediocre at one, so any non-mirror matchup is asymmetrical yet balanced

- Case studies:
  - Starcraft
  - Golden Axe (a negative example; the man is least popular)
  - Dune/CnC Generals/CnC3
