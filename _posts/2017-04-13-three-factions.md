- A post about how to come up with three factions in games, both thematically and mechanically
- http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FactionCalculus
  - Talks about classic duality of Powerhouse/Subversive, or Quality/Quantity
- One theme: normal/human faction, plus two variations on a duality theme: magic/tech, bio/tech
  - Starcraft: Terran (normal), Zerg (bio), Protoss (tech)
  - Classic RPG: Human (normal), Orc (physical), Elf (magic)
  - To make things interesting, the normal/balanced faction can be mechanically complex, e.g. special abilities
- Radical third: third faction is unique
  - Dune: Guild/Emperor/Landsraad, Guild wields soft power but doesn't want hard power
  - CnC3: Scrin are aliens
- Mechanical uniqueness: three aspects, each faction is good at one, bad at one, mediocre at one, so any non-mirror matchup is asymmetrical yet balanced
- Another aspect to consider: different objectives. Results in unbalanced yet interesting gameplay and narratives

- Case studies:
  - Starcraft
  - Golden Axe (a negative example; the man is least popular)
  - Dune/CnC Generals/CnC3
  - RA3 quite complex, with different balance on land/sea/air
