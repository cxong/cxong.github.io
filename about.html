    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>I am a hobbyist game developer; I love making games! When I'm not game jamming on random ideas, I'm tinkering on open source games.</p>

    <p>Sometimes I ramble about game dev, which amuses me and confuses others.</p>

	<p>I'm always looking out for new projects to collaborate on, whether for jams or for fun!</p>

  <p>I started making games as a hobby in 2005, with a project that was equal parts learning, portfolio building and remaking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-Dogs">a game I enjoyed</a>. The game itself went nowhere but did get me started in my professional career.</p>
  <p>After a 2-year hiatus where I absorbed my <a href="http://www.geometrian.com/programming/tutorials/write-games-not-engines/index.php">first-hand</a> <a href="http://makegames.tumblr.com/post/1136623767/finishing-a-game">lessons</a>, I rediscovered the joy of game dev through picking up the maintenance of <a href="/cdogs-sdl/">an open source game</a> in 2013. What followed were years of productive and diverse game dev where I explored game engines, built prototypes, attended jams (even winning a few) and discovered amazing communities of game makers.</p>
  <p>Take a look at the <a href="games.html">Games page</a> to see some of the stuff I've built so far. These days if I'm not tinkering on something there, I'm looking for ideas, projects and people to collaborate with. Hit me up with your game idea!</p>
